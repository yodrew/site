     	<h3>acknowledgments</h3>
 		
<p>Thanks to:</p>

<p>First and foremost, my editors, for heroic efforts to make this book real. In triage, you were as merciful as you could be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Are Solheim, writer and fellow refugee in darkness, for seeing and believing in me and the book, visionary editing, hosting me during the rewrite, and for your sly love for humanity, even me</li>
  <li>
    <p>Magnus Vanebo, philosopher, for enthusiastically diving into the text and sensitively editing it</p>

    <p>Also,</p>
  </li>
  <li>Bertrand Besigye, outlandish poet and fellow journeyman in darkness, for early support of the book</li>
</ul>

<p>Hundreds of others in eight countries on two continents over 28 years, who morally and materially aided me during my prodigal search. To name but a few:</p>

<p>Family, immediate and extended: I leaned on all of you that would let me. It can’t be easy rearing a stubborn 20, 30, then 40 year-old psychotic infant in a world that denies everything real. Thanks, especially, to</p>

<ul>
  <li>Brother Paul, for shelter you should never have had to give</li>
  <li>Grandmother Anna Lou Craig Callen Posey, always there</li>
  <li>Brother Francois, for the constant experience of love</li>
  <li>Cousin Christopher, for your generosity and grit</li>
  <li>Uncle Jim—dropout, drug dealer, beach bum, loser, cool-ass motherfucker—for laughingly giving the system the finger till the day you died. RIP.</li>
</ul>

<p>Trimurti: my second family, torn away as soon as I noticed, for helping raise me</p>

<p>Everyone named as an influence: for friendship, support, and raising the bar so high that anti-gravity boots became necessary. And especially elders:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Jack Nuckols: a giant of a man and first among my elders. RIP.</li>
  <li>Willetta Warberg: who poured her heart and soul into me</li>
  <li>John Boyer: who fed me with so much of his <em>time</em></li>
  <li>Purna Steinitz: who kept his terrible promise</li>
  <li>DeWaynn Rogers: who helped me up and kept me from the system’s clutches. RIP.</li>
  <li>Finn Po: elder, master job trainer, pioneer of the way of the future</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of you gave me the world.</p>

      <li>Marie Richert and Virginie Bournaud, friends, hosts, sponsors, and guides in Paris</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I called some people here guides, but anyone who hosted me also guided me. I’ve needed a lot of help for a long time. Everyone on this list put a lot of time and energy into me and my work. There was never any messing around.</p>

<p>Ok, maybe a little.</p>

<p>I also made enemies and hurt some people along the way. I’m sorry it didn’t go the way we thought at first. Here’s hoping it was not in vain.</p>

<p>Acknowledgments in books usually bore me. This one I cannot read without weeping again. Onward, then, till the task is complete.</p>
