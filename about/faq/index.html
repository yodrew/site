    <p><em>Do you eat in a retreat?</em></p>

    <p>Yes. Food is available all the time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>How many people retreat at once?</em></p>

    <p>One. The point of this retreat is to rest, and nothing is more stimulating than other people.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>How do you do stuff in darkness?</em></p>

    <p>Very slowly! And after getting familiar with the room and making memorable places for things.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Could you retreat with a sleeping mask?</em></p>

    <p>No. Masks are uncomfortable for a long period of time and invariably leak light. The skin has light receptors, so it would have to be covered all the time as well, even when eating, bathing, eliminating, etc. A minimally furnished room is still required to eliminate dangers, distractions, and associations. </p>

    <p>Sleeping masks are good for travel, naps, and sleeping until your bedroom can be darkened. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Will you go crazy?</em></p>

    <p>No. But force me to do anything and I probably will.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Do you get bored?</em></p>

    <p>Yes. The autonomic self sometimes works on something so damaged and painful the psyche has had to completely shut off feeling to it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>I could never do it.</em></p>

    <p>How do you feel? Right now, all that matters is whether you feel drawn to learn more about it.</p>
