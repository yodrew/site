<p>I have decided that the darkness retreat must be embedded in a life that already works well in other ways. So I am going to the midwest next week to stay at the <a href="http://planetsave.com/blog/2008/10/01/radical-simplicity-living-car-free-petroleum-free-and-electricity-free-at-the-possibility-alliance/">Possibility Alliance</a>, which I have <a href="/blog/2009/02/its-not-mine-alone/">mentioned before</a>. After languishing in Eugene for six weeks following my first failed attempt at a long darkness retreat, and exploring options here in Seattle for a month, it is clear my own happiness must become a priority. I cannot wait until the completion of a darkness retreat. And I cannot hope that anyone will really understand this before I complete one.</p>

<p>I really appreciate the comments and support various people have given me since I stumbled out of the darkness in February. Boy, what a strange couple of months it has been!</p>

<p>I have been printing up a booklet of this site’s contents in order to send it to people who have supported me in the past. If anyone would like one, let me know.</p>

<p>In other news (ha), I just finished reading a long strange mushroom trip of a book by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Pinchbeck">Daniel Pinchbeck</a> called <em>2012: The Return of Quetzalcoatl</em>. Here is an applicable quote: “It may be that the only way to survive the Apocalypse is to undergo it, first, within your own being.”</p>
