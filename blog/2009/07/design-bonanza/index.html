<p>Still here in Kansas City, MO. It is design bonanza day due to my friend’s computer’s webcam, which is an absurd but effective way of taking pictures. (edit: I retook 3 photos with a real camera. More photos soon.)</p>

<p>Anyway, the hexayurt’s up! I’m moved in and basically, it is beautiful.</p>

<p>hexayurt front, with screen door (blue tape is screen repair, and yes, that’s an impala). 6’ hexayurt ( 1’ extra height), plywood walls, OSB roof under salvaged asphalt roofing</p>

<p>hexayurt from back</p>

<p>Between my obsessiveness about details, the non-uniform, dirty, salvaged materials, and my funny toolset, it has taken way longer than expected. These things can be built in a few days if you just <a href="http://openfarmtech.org/weblog/?p=340">follow instructions</a>. C’est la vie. The hexayurt now has provisional solid and screen doors. It still needs shelving.</p>

<p>I racked my brains for three days over the design of the hexayurt’s experimental “flat octet truss” floor:</p>

<p>It was worth it, though. I’d been imagining it for a few years and finally had a chance to build it. It is much lighter than a conventional 2×4 or 2×6 joist floor. It is springy and will work nicely in the dome.</p>

<p>Now that I’m sleeping in it, I’m keeping electricity out of it. This is due partly to the influence of the <a href="http://planetsave.com/blog/2008/10/01/radical-simplicity-living-car-free-petroleum-free-and-electricity-free-at-the-possibility-alliance/">Hughes</a>, who make such excellent candles. I am using an oil lamp:</p>

<p>uses any vegetable oil or biodiesel</p>

<p>I developed it in April in Seattle for Marcus’ Martini Heaven, the Pioneer Square bar of my hard rocking high school friend, Steve Alexander.</p>

<p>Recently I built a solar shower out of a 5-gallon bucket.</p>

<p>solar shower bucket</p>

<p>A black planting bucket fits perfectly inside and heats up the water in the sun. A salvaged piece of tempered glass (framed in blue masking tape) traps the heat. A 3/8″ OD polyethylene tube comes out a 5/16″ hole toward the bottom to give a 12-minute warm shower. In use, the bucket rests on a chest-high platform I built above the tub in the bathroom. An upside-down bucket in the tub provides a seat. Our water runs cold and only to the sinks, so this baby has much improved our quality of life for the price of the tubing ($2).</p>

<p>Also I built a compost tumbler for humanure out of a plastic 55-gallon barrel. It uses my first toggle latch.</p>

<p>1/8</p>

<p>These latches totally fascinate me. However, I’m not sure the tumbler is going to work for <em>all</em> the humanure collected over the last six months (!), so we’ll build a three-bin shed in the backyard that will also act as a fence. Maybe the tumbler can go in front for food scraps. It will rest on a frame with four skateboard wheels to spin on.</p>

<p>The ever-snapping clothesline stays up finally and folks are keeping the house a lot cleaner. Three guests left, two disgruntled roommates moved out, and a smart, funny guy moved in, so things are running smoothly right now. I hope his somewhat resembles a “life that already works well in other ways” (see <a href="/blog/2009/04/midwest-bound/">midwest bound</a> post). I’m super grateful for the welcome, friendship, and shelter of the young KC crew. What is youth? The absence of resignation.</p>

<p>Oh, look. It is the 4th of July.</p>
