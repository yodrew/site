<p>The dome must be soundproof, not just sound-dampened. Enough bad experiences with noise and enough reflections by other people have finally gotten it across to me. Sound, to a lesser but still significant degree than light, will sufficiently stimulate consciousness’s fixation on the gross dimension. How much? Maybe enough to ruin a test of the conjecture. I’m not going to take that chance.</p>

<p>As much as I’d like to build it, the <a href="/blog/2009/07/spheres-for-darkness-retreats/">plysphere</a> mentioned before will not meet this new qualification. Furthermore, attempting the retreat in or near the city is also now out of the question.</p>

<p>Soundproofness, like other standards the conditions of this first test will meet, may prove non-essential. I hope so. But I will not know till I go through the test first.</p>

<p>Another project I heard about in the spring got me thinking of a corbeled straw bale dome with cob plaster and, like <a href="http://andrewdurham.shutterfly.com/172">i did with a friend in 2007</a>, a <a href="http://conicshelter.com">conic</a> roof of canvas. The design is very simple, fast, and cheap, and would work well for the retreat. I’m working on a model right now. Pics soon.</p>

<p>This also means I need a new source of funding for the dome, and a new, quiet location in the country. Maybe they’d like this at the <a href="http://planetsave.com/blog/2008/10/01/radical-simplicity-living-car-free-petroleum-free-and-electricity-free-at-the-possibility-alliance/">Possibility Alliance</a> and I should try again there.</p>

<p>We’ll see. I’m glad to have finally seen the need for soundproofness before building something.</p>

<p>What else am I missing?</p>
