<p>Here is a poem I read at age 17. It prefaces one of my favorite books, <em>Magical Child Matures</em> by Joseph Chilton Pearce. It took all this time to start seeing the meaning. If ever there were a poem of rapture, this is it.</p>

<p>~~~</p>

<h4 id="if-i-could-only-live-at-the-pitch-that-is-near-madness">If I Could Only Live at the Pitch That is Near Madness</h4>

<p>Richard Eberhart</p>

<p>If I could only live at the pitch that is near madness<br />
When everything is as it was in my childhood<br />
Violent, vivid, and of infinite possibility:<br />
That the sun and the moon broke over my head.</p>

<p>Then I cast time out of the trees and fields.<br />
Then I stood immaculate in the Ego;<br />
Then I eyed the world with all delight,<br />
Reality was the perfection of my sight.</p>

<p>And time has big handles on the hands,<br />
Fields and trees a way of being themselves.<br />
I saw battalions of the race of mankind<br />
Standing solid, demanding a moral answer.</p>

<p>I gave the moral answer and I died<br />
And into a realm of complexity came<br />
Where nothing is possible but necessity<br />
And the truth wailing there like a red babe.</p>
