  stack  of  diamonds roughly 22" on a side,weighing 70 lb. 1 1/2" high. When
  I assembled a formation of 8 of them to make a panel that was 1/15 of the
  dome, it could not be made to stand against the wall. To stiffen it so it
  could be assembled I rolled small pieces of the aluminum sheet into tubes
  and fastened them in a diamond pattern  on the inside. All fastening was
  done with Liquid Nails throughout the project.</div></TD>

It worked beautifully. Despite the structural challenges expected with a dome that weighed only 150 lb., it remained watershedding even as it flexed in the wind. It expanded and contracted as interior pressure changed with each breeze- the change in volume was evidenced as the diamond modules went from bending on the short diagonal (as was intended) to bending on the long diagonal, and back again, over and over.</div></TD>

      <TD valign="top"><div align="center">This dome was assembled with the help of some friends during a windy and
  wet March. As the winds increased, its fate seemed clear: every step I made
  to stiffen the dome caused larger sections to pop in, until at last the
  southern half blew in completely. I cut it apart , rolled it up and
  discarded it. It lasted a couple of weeks as I recall.</div></TD>
