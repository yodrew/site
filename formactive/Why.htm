              <h3><strong>Why I Build Domes </strong></h3>
              <p align="justify"><em>My primary motivation to build domes has always been to make my own home. At times I have dreamed of manufacturing low cost housing. Geodesic geometry and design is fascinating, and worthy to be pursued for a variety of reasons, but on this point I have always been clear.I yearned for the spherical space of a dome, and felt certain that a geodesic dome was the answer. </em></p>
              <p align="justify"><em>I first encountered the plydome in The Dymaxion World of Buckminster Fuller in 1974, almost 2 years after I began studying domes, and knew instantly this was a brilliant expression of a concept I had been searching for. For many years I have studied and experimented to determine the most efficient way to build a home. I grew up in the building trades, parting with conventional methods at age 19. My means were restricted from lack of space and materials, but as I grew older, able to earn a living yet unable to afford land, I invested what time and money I felt I could in experimental domes and models. My wife Cynthia only left me once in the 15 years that passed before we moved into our spherical home.</em></p>
              <p align="justify"><em> I was 44 years old when I built our place. The house itself was a small expense compared to buying the land, drilling a well, and having the driveway, septic and electricity put in. It is also a small expense when property tax is due, so our dome has fulfilled our hopes for a comfortable home that supports us instead of draining our resources. The third floor apartment we had formerly lived in was more expensive on a per year basis. I have been asked if I had thought about resale value. No. We plan to stay here. This is the most comfortable, pleasant place in which I have ever lived (although the original house is rather small). And the dome's value to us the past nine years is more than we have in it.</em><em> Designing homes for people in other parts of the world has not been a goal. I don't understand the problem well enough, and I didn't think I could have credibility attempting to house people in India if I was unable to provide this kind of shelter for my own family. I also wonder what would make their needs strikingly different from mine. </em></p>
              <p align="justify"><em>I am still building. The domes I make are economical of material and require much careful work. I don't have to scrimp on labor because I like doing this. My profession is seasonal, and I frequently get opportunities to work on my expanding home. My effort has been a ruthless pursuit of economy, an unusual respect for the materials I use, and a greater willingness to invest time than money. </em></p>
