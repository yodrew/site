      <p align="left"><em>After living in the sphere for six years, I decided to make a better 
      roof. The metal cone was good at keeping snow off the top, but 
      sometimes chunks of ice would fall off and chip  paint off the 
      plywood. The metal cone was so large that it trapped hot air in the <br>
      summer, and it was made of galvanized steel, which would rust.Worst of all, despite my efforts to correct it, the metal boomed 
      in high winds. The casement windows on the second floor would have to 
      be closed during rain because there was only a stingy overhang.<br>
      Home Depot had started offering trimcoil, painted aluminum flashing 
      in 24&quot;x50 ft. rolls. This motivated me to finalize a design that had 
      been developing in my mind for many years. I bought several rolls and 
      cut them into diamonds, and screwed them into place on a Starplate 
      icosahedron shed.The roof worked 
        perfectly.</em></p>

      <p align="left"><em> After a wet summer I decided to use the aluminum roof on our house. 
          I was eager to get started. At 51, I thought it wise to do this task 
          while I still could. It was necessary to install a permanent roof 
          because the dome is sheathed with 1/4&quot; plywood. A standard roof 
          design that would require periodic replacement would soon destroy the 
          dome.<br>
          First I framed awnings to protect the windows.(awnings1.jpg) Plywood 
          was expensive at the time, August 2004, and I was fortunate to find 
          1200 bf of tongue and groove cedar at a good price. The cedar is a 
          pleasant change from the plywood. Then I removed the metal cone along 
          with several wasp nests. The wasps weren't bad, but a cloud of 
          hornets made me jump off an awning onto the adjoining lower plydome. 
        It was like a six foot drop onto a trampoline. Plydomes are bouncy. </em></p>

      </table>
      <p align="left"><em>          Using ropes and ladders I carried 5 sheets of 3/8&quot; plywood to the 
            top of the sphere and made the new ventilator-a smaller one with a 
            rotorlike design I call the fat helicopter. I 
            covered it with brown aluminum. Then I put down some ice and water 
          shield around the top of the sphere, and began screwing the diamond 
          shaped shingles, starting at the top. This aspect of the roof design 
          was helpful, because aluminum is soft and easily damaged. I didn't 
        have to climb or kneel on the aluminum.</em></p>
      <table width="600" border="0" align="center" cellpadding="10">
        <tr>
          <td width="279"><div align="center"><em><br>
  Around the high part of the sphere I worked on a 4 ft. stepladder suspended by a pair of ropes, tied to the steel tubes that supported the ventilator.</em></div></td>

      <p align="left"><em>I felt uneasy at times, particularly 
          on the south side where the land drops off. But the ropes held, and I 
          was able to carefully fit the metal pieces to the somewhat irregular 
          plydome surface. A standard geodesic with flat triangles and more 
          distinct edges would have been easier.<br>
          My wife Cynthia was upset by the ugliness of the roof when I tore 
          the cone off, and did not hang around to take pictures, so the photos 
        are largely uninhabited on this project. </em></p>

      <p align="left"><em>          The roof has worked very well. During snowfalls, snow continually 
          slides off the steep, slippery surface. As a young man roofing houses 
          during the seventies I noticed how well aluminum held up in this 
          region, and always thought aluminum shingles would work. I can drive 
          by roofs I worked on then and see the aluminum looking almost new 
          after 30 years. So I am planning on the roofs I have installed on the 
        sphere, the dome and the Starplate to last as long as the buildings. </em></p>
