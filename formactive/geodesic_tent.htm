      <p><em>We had a great time with it, setting it up in several states. At state parks and festivals it looked huge among the manufactured camping dome tents. We lived in it for 6 weeks when we moved to North Carolina. With a floor mat made of Astrofoil bubblepack insulation we made it through many frosty nights. A bowl of coals from the campfire warmed things up. Later we burned charcoal in a small metal grill. There was good ventilation: all my domes have holes in the top with raincovers. Without a hole in the top moisture will accumulate. We used the tent again when we returned to Vermont to build our house, and slept in a small dome tent inside the big canvas one until the temperature dropped too far below freezing. </em></p>

I used this on the ferrocement zome I put on the front of our house.

I tried 2 other hub types while we were traveling: the first were polycarbonate "stubby stars" that fit inside the metal tubes, and were held in place by cotter pins. These were rigid enough, but not strong enough. The second type was made of 6" pieces of vinyl water hose with a bolt through them and discs to stiffen the assembly.They were held fast to the struts with hose clamps. These were strong enough, but sagged. This third hub design is less portable, and is screwed together with sheet metal screws; it is both strong and rigid enough to hold the tent snugly even with snow. The conduit will bend before the hubs will fail. </td>
