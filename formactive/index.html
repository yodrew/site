<h3>The Door</h3>

The door is like the one I have on my house. It is the third complete 
change in design I have tried, and it is completely satisfactory for us. 
My earlier doors, with curved frames of bent plywood, such as the one 
described in the last article, were functional, but not as good as the 
polygon one for hingeing. Curved doors present difficulties. I have 
worked out a door that is easy to hang on standard door hinges, and , 
despite its outward tilt, opens inward easily, keeping its bottom edge 
relatively level with the floor. I have done my best to minimize the 
momentum of this off balance door. My daughter in kindergarten can open 
and shut it. It is a tall  hexagon with hinges on one lower side of the 
door. It is mounted  in  a 2x10 frame with the door flush with the 
interior edges of the frame. When it is left open the top flops back at 
an angle, and will stay open. The door itself is a lightweight sandwich 
type with outside layers of 1/4" luaun plywood (which measures 3/16") 
and an inner edge of pine boards or 2x4's, and an additional piece 
inside to provide stiffening across the middle. Since the door closes 
with a pronounced outward tilt,we didn't use a doorknob. We found a 
pretty piece of an apple tree branch with a good shape for a handle, and 
lagscrewed it on  from the inside. We did another handle from the 
outside. Then we bought a deadbolt that locks from inside and out. 
Unfortunately, I made our door with 2x4 pieces around the edge between 
the plywood sandwich, and had to do a lot of chiselling to make a 
standard deadbolt lock fit the thick door. If you can find boards a full 
inch thick, or 1 1/8", that will work with a locking deadbolt. But the 1 
1/2" dimension of standard 2x4's plus the thickness of two layers of 
thin plywood is too much for some standard door hardware. Standard 
doorknob sets worked on my earlier, equally  thick doors. So 2x4's will 
do with some doorknobs, probably most.<p>
The frame requires only one special angle throughout, 17 degrees from 
vertical. This is the angle I set my hand held circular saw for all the 
cuts. Look carefully at how the corners go together, carefully determine 
lengths of pieces from the dimensions. For instance, the top and bottom 
pieces show a measurement of 24" corner to corner, but that is the short 
dimension. The angles widen from there. This is a real measure twice cut 
once situation. I found it helpful to lay out the hexagon on a sheet of 
plywood, and assemble the pieces on there. Then the frame will not get 
distorted during assembly.<p>
This hexagon can be drawn most easily and accurately by first drawing a 
tall rectangle 24" wide and 78" tall. A horizontal bisector (cuts it in 
half) extending 12" out on each side will reach the remaining corners. 
The door is of course smaller than the frame by the width of the frame 
all around (so it will fit inside) plus another 1/8" so it won't stick 
tight.<p>
I fastened my frame together with metal plates made from leftover sheet 
metal (9" squares will do), and 1" #10 sheet metal screws. The plates are bent 
around the six outside corners of the frame. I fastened the frame to the 
plywood with 10 short blocks of 2x4 around the inside, lagscrewed 
through the plywood into the blocks, and nailed through the frame into 
the blocks. During this step I had the frame braced with diagonal pieces 
of wood to keep it from distorting. A stop running around the inside of 
the frame of 1x4 pine covers some of the nails and holds the door in 
place when shut. The door itself is fastened together with many 1 1/4" 
#10 sheet metal screws, through the plywood into the wooden braces. If 
you use 1" wood inside the door, use 1" long screws.<p>
The virtue of this hexagonal door is that the door does not need to be 
lifted much when it swings inward, because it does not rise much, and 
does not have much momentum when it is closed, outward. The angle where 
the hinges mount on the door counters the outward tilt of the door and 
minimizes the unwieldy quality of other designs I have tried. I welcome 
innovators to try round doors. The hinges on round doors require special 
attention. A round door with a small, vertical flat side to mount the 
hinges would help the situation. Doors get a lot of use. We are a much 
happier family now that we have a door that functions properly. A poorly 
performing door is a constant annoyance.<p>
I have included a drawing which shows how to locate the corners of the 
hexagon from the inside of the assembled dome. The corners of the 
triangular vertex holes, and the bottom center of a base sheet of 
plywood, are the reference points. Assume right angles where it appears 
to be so. Drill the six corners through to the outside, and connect them 
with straight lines, and saw the hole when you are satisfied it is a 
close fit to the frame. The frame, when properly braced to hold it 
rigid, can be held up to the inside of the dome, corners matched with 
marks or holes, to anticipate the fit.<p>
Once the frame is in ,and the door hung, the frame should be flashed or 
caulked to seal it tight to the dome. A stop running around the inside 
of the frame of 1x4 pine or some appropriate trim  covers some of the 
nails and holds the door in place when shut.<p>
