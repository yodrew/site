    <td width="635"><p><em>The construction of the hillside cottage began a year after the big plydome. After building large, I was quite at ease working with an 18ft. diameter structure. We assembled the plywood sheets almost completely before mounting the posts in what resembles a Tiffany setting. This little building is beautifully crafted, and was in my mind a prototype. The patterning is simple: all the sheets of plywood are drilled the same, and there are only two kinds of polycarbonate windows. Hardware is stainless steel machine screws for nearly everything.</em></p>
    <p><em>Because the cottage is extremely light, the airborne design seemed appropriate. The 9 ft. diameter pods that extend from the larger sphere weigh only about 350 lb. The locust posts that provide foundation go 5 ft. into the clay and small rocks were packed into the postholes. A young couple moved into the cottage and named it Chrysalis. It is a primitive 3-season dwelling they lived in year round for perhaps three years. We installed a wood stove, they ran cold water in; there was never any insulation. The little green dome is the outhouse.. </em></p></td>
