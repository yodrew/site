<h4 id="section">1992-93</h4>

<h5 id="existence">Existence</h5>

<p>I am full to bursting<br />
I am a dandelion drooping with dew<br />
I am my swollen lower lip and quaking eyes,<br />
lusting for her flesh and loins</p>

<p>I am a cat tensed to pounce<br />
I am my skin stretched tight and tingling<br />
over clean sinew and bone<br />
My muscle strands stream over them<br />
Like the river over stone</p>

<p>And it comes<br />
Finally<br />
To the sea<br />
I am awash<br />
I am alone<br />
I am come to me</p>

<h5 id="axioms">Axioms</h5>

<p>Words I cannot hold<br />
For the stars shine right through them<br />
It is the stars that I contemplate tonight</p>

<p>They are steady and quiet<br />
While meteors and eclipses<br />
Bustling this way and that<br />
Fawn for attention</p>

<p>Their presence is subtle and final<br />
To those who look<br />
They are indifferent<br />
To those who see<br />
They are obliged</p>

<p>Seeker<br />
Pause<br />
There is breath beneath your breath<br />
And words<br />
Beneath the words which escape you<br />
Words that should<br />
In every waking moment<br />
Hum in your head</p>

<p>In stillness<br />
One falls<br />
Touches old bruises<br />
Exhaustion<br />
Longing<br />
And returns to the meanings of those<br />
Underwords</p>

<h5 id="who-needs-it">Who Needs It</h5>

<p>– to the memory of Ayn Rand</p>

<p>By definition<br />
I am conscious.<br />
Correct</p>

<p>It can work<br />
Only one way<br />
It: everything there is<br />
What is it?<br />
Name it<br />
The feeling of identification is pleasure<br />
And nothing can alter that fact</p>

<p>I wanted so much to want<br />
I could not break any laws<br />
Then what?<br />
Which way?<br />
What had scattered the signs<br />
From the roads that lead off from here<br />
Could it mark them again</p>

<p>The thing to pull it all together<br />
What would it be…<br />
What would it be?<br />
By definition<br />
Philosophy</p>

<h5 id="my-father-lives-in-twin-falls-idaho">My Father Lives in Twin Falls, Idaho</h5>

<p>I am not the kind<br />
Who can walk down a main street with impunity<br />
My body is a monolith<br />
My blood stands still<br />
The numbness is a forcefield<br />
Which a draws a dangerous man close to me</p>

<p>I am going to the open desert<br />
For safety<br />
To be worn clean<br />
So that I may never have to walk down a main street again</p>

<h5 id="right-now">Right Now</h5>

<p>The very best thing possible is happening<br />
I am living</p>

<p>Food falls down my throat<br />
And my chilled flesh<br />
-it does not go to the bone anymore-<br />
Warms in this temporarily benevolent fluorescence</p>

<p>I have just enough time to regain my direction<br />
And the will to reenter a damp canyon<br />
Where again<br />
I’ll find the courage to sleep</p>

<p>To walk a mile<br />
To go from this glow<br />
To trees and a moonlit creek<br />
Is to crumple into the hand of a giant<br />
Who rests a world away</p>

<p>I am ready<br />
This was worth six bits</p>

<h5 id="disguise">Disguise</h5>

<p>I have collapsed into depravity<br />
By way of prodigality<br />
I hoped that you are fooled<br />
And I hope that you are amused<br />
By my efforts to nobility</p>

<p>Mine is the disguise of a spy<br />
Who is about to depart enemy territory<br />
For the last time<br />
He is tired<br />
More and more<br />
He feels that he did not penetrate it<br />
But that his own fatherland<br />
Deeply screwed him</p>

<p>Ergo the appearance of a wastrel<br />
Yes, I’ve squandered the money I’ve earned<br />
But what I’ve been given<br />
I’ve spent well</p>

<p>Now<br />
I’ve laid the plan<br />
And collected the gear<br />
I am vacating my place here<br />
Listen for a whoosh<br />
Then a crash<br />
An implosion, I think<br />
Will be a fitting end<br />
To this place and this mask</p>

<h5 id="man">Man</h5>

<p>No proper adjective<br />
No possible qualifier<br />
Common: Contradictory<br />
Independent: Redundant<br />
Pluralization: Impossible</p>

<p>Exclusion of the unwilling<br />
By definition<br />
His identity<br />
Free, alone, complete<br />
A city-state-nation unto himself</p>

<p>This…<br />
…<br />
Quiet, he says<br />
The mob absent<br />
The comportment of his soul<br />
Named</p>

<h5 id="the-words">The Words</h5>

<p>Hear now the words<br />
Which beseech thee to perceive their origins:<br />
Freedom<br />
Heaven<br />
Life</p>

<p>Dumb and still you were<br />
Till their vibrations<br />
Cohered inside your head</p>

<p>Flowering language<br />
Trumpeted from every peak<br />
Drowns if a child whispers them<br />
In some lonely glen</p>

<p>The crickets and the wind will cease their own movements<br />
And conspire to aid him<br />
Lifting his feet<br />
And covering their fall amidst enemies<br />
Who writhe and languish all around</p>

<p>First the air into the lung<br />
To start the friction for the tongue<br />
To forge into a rapier drawn<br />
Thy thoughts! behold thy foe hast gone</p>

<p>No potent threat can be heard<br />
By the one who seeks and speaks these words</p>

<h5 id="may-i-have-this-last-dance">May I have this last dance?</h5>

<p>I have my secret<br />
And I am going<br />
Do you hear?<br />
I am going, I am going!</p>

<p>At last the boat docks and I depart<br />
The oars and sails are my spokesmen<br />
Do you listen?<br />
They bid you adieu</p>

<p>You needn’t hear me say it again<br />
For I am going<br />
A thousand, thousand times you’ve heard it from me<br />
But now it is true</p>

<p>I am going<br />
I am going<br />
I am gone</p>

<h5 id="untitled">untitled</h5>

<p>In the dark<br />
In the deep<br />
In the stone<br />
In the keep</p>

<p>There is I<br />
With the key<br />
And the sky<br />
Envelopes me</p>

<p>The sea’s drops<br />
The Earth’s rocks<br />
The jetty heavens<br />
Time stops</p>

<p>Breathe in, breathe out<br />
The seething din and the shout<br />
Resonate in the settling calm<br />
The tones, now heard<br />
now dancing in my palm</p>

<h5 id="planet-and-world">Planet and World</h5>

<p>Never have I considered these things as the same</p>

<p>Here is the planet, Earth<br />
I can touch it<br />
And live here<br />
It sings to me<br />
And if I break a limb<br />
I bury it<br />
And cease eating<br />
And rise in three weeks<br />
Whole</p>

<p>There is this world<br />
—a coalition of polities on a planet—<br />
In which people live unsecretly<br />
There, we cannot hide what we are, what we do<br />
It all comes out<br />
It is all there<br />
And look at it</p>

<p>Then there is the world that could be<br />
Another world<br />
Separate or greater<br />
A world of freedom<br />
That one can found</p>

<p>Tinder gathers on its blueprint<br />
Some now aim their sparks there<br />
A breeze collects itself</p>

<p>You will see others smeared with grey<br />
Some walking<br />
Some dead<br />
Before the rains, everything will be grey<br />
This new world will rise<br />
From ashes</p>

<h4 id="present">1999 – present</h4>

<h5 id="eating-bitter">Eating Bitter</h5>

<p>I see every truth<br />
And every falsehood<br />
Resolve to truth</p>

<p>Finally I am fed<br />
By all this bitterness<br />
For it was salt that grew it<br />
Salt and humus<br />
The blood of so many gone before</p>

<p>Including me<br />
Yes I was here before<br />
I wept and died here countless times<br />
Horses would crush my body<br />
And kick it into the canal<br />
Where it would catch<br />
On branches and barbed wire<br />
And decompose into beds<br />
For native flowers that never bloom<br />
And malva and sheep sorrel and fat hen</p>

<p>That today<br />
I sit by the water<br />
In the seat of longing<br />
And eat<br />
And eat<br />
Until the hunger is satisfied</p>

<p>Twin Falls 1999 Jul</p>

<h5 id="not-quite">Not Quite</h5>

<p>What happens<br />
If I tell you<br />
That ecstasy always plays at my bones<br />
Catches my breath<br />
Wipes out history?</p>

<p>What will it be for me-<br />
Cross or scaffold?<br />
Do you have any idea<br />
How much you hate purity?<br />
How ferociously you cultivate<br />
the drama of pain and achievement?</p>

<p>But this only provokes<br />
Your “Work,”<br />
As if, somehow,<br />
God left something undone.</p>

<h5 id="grasss-benediction">Grass’s benediction</h5>

<p>Grass is benediction<br />
To my feet</p>

<p>I had forgotten<br />
Shoes clogged my brain</p>

<p>If you’re strong<br />
You can eat it<br />
Said the tough-footed boy</p>

<p>Across the valley<br />
Bare-limbed disiduous trees<br />
The beard of the hills</p>

<p>And the clouds<br />
Write themselves<br />
On paper</p>

<h5 id="audience-with-myself">Audience With Myself</h5>

<p>If I could meet myself<br />
At this point in my life<br />
I would place all my hopes in myself</p>

<p>My secret longing for the sacred<br />
Would find second wind<br />
In the clues falling from my lips<br />
In the excited tension throughout my back<br />
In my sweet wish to make love<br />
To marry any one<br />
Of the beautiful, perfectly loveable women I meet everyday<br />
Everyone of whom I feel myself falling in love with</p>

<p>I would throw myself at my feet, sobbing,<br />
Deliver me! Deliver me! You are my only hope!<br />
I would beg all the saints<br />
Disguised as the ordinary people<br />
Who surround this self of my present<br />
Please help him to help me,<br />
To remember me<br />
Remember all his own failings, which I am<br />
Remember everything that led me to this point<br />
Remember everyone like me<br />
Sobbing at our own feet, Deliver me! Deliver me!</p>

<p>If I could meet myself at this point in my life<br />
I would place all my hopes in myself<br />
Seal my love<br />
For myself, for life, for others, for this lovely Earth,<br />
Seal it in wax<br />
Feed it to the flame in the hearts<br />
Of all ourselves<br />
Whom we might now meet at this point in our lives<br />
Again and again and again and again</p>

<p>LV 2001 Mar</p>

<h5 id="b">1.19.02 4 b</h5>

<p>Did I storm your yard?<br />
I bid you relax<br />
Then caught you off guard<br />
Now I know the facts</p>

<p>Now your face is too much<br />
Only your feet can play in my mind<br />
These I can see and touch<br />
Without going numb or blind</p>

<p>These rhymes spring from love<br />
Won’t you believe this old heart?<br />
Fly to me flitting dove<br />
May we nevermore be apart</p>

<p>You are wine, I, a drunken cup<br />
The sky opens and you pour down<br />
At the first red drops I look up<br />
At the receding blue before I drown</p>

<h5 id="kamikazes">Kamikazes</h5>

<p>When love becomes a life and death matter<br />
Even sweeping the floor is urgent</p>

<p>In washing the dishes<br />
the universe hangs in the balance<br />
Swallowing morsels of food<br />
stuns and dumbfounds even the quick and articulate<br />
A salad is a vision of god<br />
And just sitting down is an act of war</p>

<p>Who is the gremlin<br />
That gives things meaning?</p>

<p>It occupies my heart<br />
It has locked itself in<br />
It is making ransom demands<br />
It intimates that you are in its care<br />
But for how long!</p>

<p>These things cannot, however, concern me<br />
I lean back<br />
Let the sun hit my neck<br />
Like so many kamikazes<br />
Coming in</p>

<p>Seattle 2001 Dec</p>

<h5 id="the-crest-and-the-trough">The crest and the trough</h5>

<p>Waiting for an opening<br />
And then<br />
Into the breach</p>

<p>Endless controls<br />
Waffling toward zero</p>

<p>I touch a place now<br />
where I cannot<br />
Move against my feeling<br />
Anymore</p>

<p>Satloka 2004 Jan</p>

<h5 id="corduroy-classic-2001">Corduroy Classic 2001</h5>

<p>– for Micha Grainger</p>

<p>Youth, man: that’s IT<br />
Said Micha</p>

<p>Micha chases a lost rabbit<br />
The furbearer of his people<br />
Multiplying<br />
Soft<br />
Despised<br />
Elusive</p>

<p>See his comical corduroy cap<br />
His flaring pants<br />
The missing white member<br />
Of Fat Albert’s gang<br />
Showing up late<br />
The party’s second wind</p>

<p>Look!<br />
Old-school court shoes<br />
Improbably shined and flashing<br />
Twisting on the carpet<br />
Hands waving like daisies<br />
Laughter springing up goofy<br />
and hip:<br />
For the people<br />
For his people</p>

<p>Others chase their own dreams<br />
Micha chases the dream of his people<br />
Assured and fleet<br />
On his lucky furry feet</p>

<h5 id="breathe">Breathe</h5>

<p>There is no agency<br />
—let alone free agency—<br />
Only one long chain of life<br />
Binding us all to its winding course</p>

<p>Belong to it!<br />
Your strains against it<br />
Only pull it tighter against the rest of us<br />
Against we<br />
Who will bear it smiling<br />
Be assured</p>

<p>For what choice have we?<br />
Strain, do not strain:<br />
We belong<br />
It has us<br />
Has us</p>

<p>en route to Boise 2005 Aug 11</p>

<h5 id="the-battle-of-wounded-knee">The Battle of Wounded Knee</h5>

<p>– for Rob Bolman</p>

<p>The traveler of pregnant faith<br />
Sets foot on the distant path<br />
God is with him<br />
God is with him</p>

<p>Sing god’s name with his<br />
God is everything<br />
And he is only dust<br />
Yet sing their names together</p>

<p>Many hopes follow on his heels<br />
Like friendly cats<br />
Longing pours from his eyes<br />
Unbearable tension rips his limbs from his body<br />
But he pulls himself forward by his chin and forehead,<br />
his abdomen and pelvis</p>

<p>God is with him<br />
God awaits him<br />
With prostheses that work better<br />
Than the arms and legs<br />
Of a born champion:<br />
This one will be made</p>

<p>Among the six billion cells of Maitreya’s body<br />
This one finds his way home twice:<br />
in leaving and in returning</p>

<p>Godspeed, traveler,<br />
Closing his door and already far away,<br />
Godspeed.</p>

<p>Eugene 2006 Jan</p>
