<p>Please help translate my book into Norwegian or Swedish!</p>

<p>A famous Norwegian writer has promised to help get my book published once it is translated into Norwegian. My editors, Magnus Vanebo and Are Solheim are ready to edit a rough Norwegian or Swedish translation from you into publishable Norwegian. Translate as much as you like, from a single paragraph to the whole book!</p>

<p>In return, I will credit you the equivalent of regular translation fees. Credit is good for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>copies of my book</li>
  <li>entrance to my talks</li>
  <li>consultations with me</li>
  <li>a darkroom retreat at an affiliated Hygienic darkroom retreat facility</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="how-to-translate">how to translate</h4>

<ol>
  <li>If you did not already receive an invitation to edit the following documents, email me that you want to translate (see <a href="/about/">about</a> for address). I will send you an invitation as soon as possible.</li>
  <li>Go to one of these pages and see what needs to be translated and edited:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jnpSLFf4kJ5zd1WBA9cMwDGe4WyAeqsGhOu0bDX8XX8">front</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17dD2KclxCX-ibHSGgqPur8Qlr3Ov2X3ggnnOHe2H588">main</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jnpSLFf4kJ5zd1WBA9cMwDGe4WyAeqsGhOu0bDX8XX8">about</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Wherever you see English, translate it to Norwegian or Swedish. Delete the English as you go, one paragraph at a time. Keep in mind that others may be thinking of translating the same thing at the same time. If you see a another cursor moving around, pick another paragraph/section/chapter to work on.</li>
  <li>Comment on or edit an existing translation</li>
  <li>Tips:
    <ul>
      <li>If Google Docs responds slowly to your keyboard, use a text editor on your own computer to write your translation. Copy and paste it into the Google Doc (and delete the English) one paragraph at a time.</li>
      <li>Translate the text first with <a href="http://translate.google.com">Google Translate</a>, then edit it into completely readable Norwegian or Swedish. This can save you some work. Barely knowing Spanish, I translated a whole Spanish website into English this way.</li>
      <li>Don’t worry about messing it up because you can’t! Document history is automatically saved and earlier versions are easily recovered.</li>
      <li>It is also easy to see who makes changes so credit can be given properly later.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="formatting">formatting</h4>

<p>Please imitate the funny plain text formatting you see in the English. For example:</p>

<pre><code>#### Use hash marks for headings (blank line above and below)

Use _underscores_ to italicize a word  and **double asteriks** for bold. Put a 
blank line between paragraphs.

1. Use numbering
2. like this

- and dashes 
- like this for lists.
    - Sub-lists are indented 4 spaces like this one
    - blank lines go above and below whole list
</code></pre>

<p>This simple syntax is part of a plain text-based formatting method called Markdown. Using a converter, I can turn this plain text document into properly formatted rich text for web or print.</p>

<p>Now I use Markdown to write everything, so I don’t depend on word processors (like Word) to make structured, good-looking documents anymore, just plain text editors. First, the plain text itself <em>looks</em> logical and formatted. Once converted, it is so. This also makes sharing documents with others easier because plain text is the universal filetype.</p>

<p>It takes minutes to learn. You will find it in more and more places on the web. Read more <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">here</a> and <a href="http://whatismarkdown.com/">here</a>. Don’t worry if you’re unsure you got everything right. I will check everything.</p>
